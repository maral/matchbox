# Matchbox algebra
Simple interactive math app for demonstrating equations basics based on [an applet of the same name](http://66.147.244.109/~mathsapp/mathsapplets/page2/page54/index.html) that is no longer working. App was written in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), awesome JavaScript frontend library. App was
set up using a tool [Create React app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can [see it live](https://maral.github.io/matchbox/)!

## How to run
1. You need Node.js installed and be able to run `npm` command in console.
2. `cd` to the root directory of this project (where the `package.json` file is located).
3. Install dependencies: run `npm i`.
4. Start developing: run `npm start`. This will start the development server and open the app in browser. All your changes in source files will be immediately hotloaded to the browser after saving.
5. Build the app for production: run `npm run build`. Ready files will be found in the `build` folder.
